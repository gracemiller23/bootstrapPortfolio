                    <p>The first thing you should know about me is that writing was my first love. There is nothing quite like the chess
                        match of targeting an audience effectively, whether you want to bring them to tears or sell them something.
                        And there's little in the world that compares to the satisfaction of a properly used semicolon.</p>
                    <p>Except, perhaps, for
                        <span class="bold">web development.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>For over 5 years as a freelance writer and editor, I learned to target audiences in both editorial and marketing
                        contexts, and all too often it came down to two things: rhetoric and precision. The art of communicating
                        clearly and persuading others - to have a reaction, to make a change, to believe in something ... or buy
                        something. It was an intensive study of human nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>I worked with many websites and realized that the people behind the code and I shared similar goals. Soon, I
                        was drawn to the dark side. The only difference is that, as developers, we strive to guide and communicate
                        with users through graphic interfaces and experiences. The chess match is all about understanding users well
                        enough to create functionalities that are useful and accessible. I fell in love with the challenge of stretching
                        my skills and experience.</p>
                    <p>Today, I'm typing
                        <span class="bold">HTML, CSS, and Javascript</span> instead of articles and marketing campaigns, while studying to be a Full
                        Stack Web Developer at the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. If you are interested in learning more about
                        my background or how my unique skillset can support your development goals, please
                        <a href="contact.html">contact me today</a>.</p>
                    <p>Here's what I'm learning: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, Node.js, PHP frameworks (like Laravel,
                        MySQL, and Heroku), security and session storage, and user authentication.</p>
